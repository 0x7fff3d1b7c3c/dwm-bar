## Installation
1. Clone and enter the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joestandring/dwm-bar
$ cd dwm-bar
```
2. Make the script executable
```
$ chmod +x dwm_bar.sh
```
## Usage
Simply run the script and dwm should display your bar:
```
$ ./dwm_bar.sh
```
If you would like your bar to be displayed when X starts, add this to your .xinitrc file before launching dwm. For example, if the script is located in /home/$USER/dwm-bar/:
```
# Statusbar
/home/$USER/dwm-bar/dwm_status.sh &

# Start dwm
exec dwm
```
## Customizing
dwm-bar is completley modular, meaning you can mix and match functions to your hearts content. It's functions are located in the functions/ subdirectory and included in dwm_bar.sh
If you want to make your own function, for example dwm_myfunction.sh, you should create it in the functions/ subdirectory before including it in dwm_bar.sh and adding it to the xsetroot command:
```
# Import the modules
. "$DIR/functions/dwm_myfucntion"

while true
do
    xsetroot -name "$(dwm_myfunction)"
    sleep 1
done
```
